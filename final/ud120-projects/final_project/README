Usage
=====

python poi_id.py

Please note that this version works with a modified dataset (final_project_dataset_modified.pkl) and features (final_project_features_list_modified.pkl). The modified dataset contains a new feature 'mentions' which is generated from the email bodies, this has been pre-generated for speed (takes ~ 10 minutes) by executing 'add_mention_features.py' as a standalone app.

Alternatively you can execute the following command which generates the new feature in line (using 'add_mention_features.py' as a library). This assumes though that the email corpus is present in directory - './enron_mail_20110402/'. This is not provided (by me) in github as the dataset is so large.

python poi_id_ada_mentions.py features.txt


Files
=====

Documents
---------

* documents/report.pdf - answers to questions
* documents/results.ods/xls - for completeness, table detailing output perfomance for different combinations of algorithm/features


Implementations
---------------

* poi_id.py - final version of my poi_id

* poi_id_ada_mentions_pregen.py - as per poi_id.py
* poi_id_ada_mentions.py - with in line 'mentions' feature generation

For compleness, other implementations I tried:

* poi_id_dt.py
* poi_id_kn.py
* poi_id_nb.py
* poi_id_rf.py
* poi_id_svm.py


Feature Generation
------------------

* add_features.py - library to add a feature combining email to/from and shared receipt (not used in final version)
* add_mention_features.py - library to add feature counting poi mentions in sent email bodies
* poi_identifiers.py - helper dict mapping known poi's to their names and email addresses for feature generation


Features
--------

Various combinations of features to use:

* features.txt - final chosen set of features
* features_v0.txt
* features_v1.txt
* features_v2.txt
* features_v3.txt
* features_v4.txt - as per features.txt
* features_v5.txt


Outlier Analysis/Removal
------------------------

* enron_outliers.py - script used to investigate outliers (run independently ahead of poi_id.py)
* outlier_cleaner.py - library used to actually remove outliers


Feature Re-Scaling
------------------

* rescale_features.py - library used for min max feature re-scaling (not used in final version)
